# for loop - if you know the no of times to repeat the action then proceed with for loop

# for i in range(1,10,1):  # start,stop,step
#     # print(i)  # print 1 to 9
#     print(i,end='')  # print 1 to 9 in same line

# for j in range (2,11):  # start,stop  (by default step value is taken as 1)
#     print(j) # print 2 to 10

# for a in range (6):  # stop (by default it will take start value as 0, step value as 1)
#     print(a)  # print 0 to 5
